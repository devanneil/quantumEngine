# quantumEngine
Quantum Engine is going to be a fully modular 3D Graphics and Physics engine. Quantum Engine is fully open source. The eventual goal is to allow users to modify Quantum Engine however they feel fit. Currently Quantum Engine can only do math.

# Project Status
Quantum Engine currently is an overglorified calculator, however once all of the required functionality is implemented we will build and apply the first mod to Quantum Engine where we will build a translator to translate between qVec and qMat to openGL equivilent. This way we will be able to begin drawing with openGL, though the plan is to eventually have our own graphics library.
