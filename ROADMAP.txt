The Roadmap for Quantum Engine and the Todo's as it stands:

IMPORTANT:
Current required tools
mingw or equivalent
cmake
OpenGL
GLWF (will install itself at build)

To develop a minimum viable product Quantum Engine needs all of these features:
3D Graphics implementation for several file types
    Successfully prove swapping graphics engines
    Interactable with 3D features
    Input/Output handling and recognition

Coherent project management UI and file structure
    Able to select files and modules on a session by session basis
    Export completed projects with and without associated modules

Module control and mechanisms
    User defined modules
    Seamlessly add modules and swap equivalent parts

Further development 
    Asset store for modules and project parts
    Remote development support
    Node based shader/pipeline editor
    Version control

Current TODOs
    Verify current version stability for Windows and Linux systems
        qFile will help with this
        fix qMat and qVec double free errors
        verify memory security
    qFile as file wrapper and handler
        hanle opening and closing of all files
        organize files into a folder system
        handle IO functions
    Rebuild qMesh and qOpenGL to be more modular
        use qFile to handle file interactions
        improve modularity using c preprocessor
        export as one module which can be easily used in place of another
    Build input/output system
        modularity is incredibly important as just using GLFW will not work with Vulkan or DX systems
        likely need to be handled on a seperate thread from rendering
    Modularize screen and rendering
        unsure yet how to proceed, will need time to experiment and ideas
