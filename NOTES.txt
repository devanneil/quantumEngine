Potential fixes:
    qMat and qVec do not always check for nullpointer
    When printing error matrixes it seems likely that the uninitialized vectors are null. This is not correct behaviour as they should be an array of 0.
    Run gdb backtrace to find out more
    It seems likely that the issue is with move semantics. I will need to research how to implement them.
